The purpose of this project is to create a reminder/tracking web application that is customizable. When brainstorming
project ideas, we realized many had a theme involving reminders and tracking goals. Initially this will be a

hope to be able to utilize the application in our day-to-day lives beyond LiftOff.

Method to set time/date to creation of reminder/tracker and how to ensure reminders alert at the correct
time/date.
